# dataset_o.3.6
This project stores a small version of the dataset of multi-view videos of human actions (MVVHAs). MVVHAs is a dataset of multi-view videos (MVV).
In this small vertion, each MVV has 24 (8 x 3) Single-View Videos (SVVs) showing the same action from 24 differnt viewpoints.


This small version of the MVVHAs was designed for my online psychology experiments that are listed at [https://ccalafiore.github.io](https://ccalafiore.github.io).
The big version of the dataset for deep learning experiments needs to be requested.
